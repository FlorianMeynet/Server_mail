# Server_mail
We create this projet with a group of friends ! 

It is a project in which we developped a code which allows us to receive e-mails from any servor (google, yahoo ...) but also to send e-mails to any servor using smtp and imap library. We can send and read emails with attachments and we use a SQLite database to connect to each servor depending on the mail we use. To connect to our mail box, we have to connect from Python but we have to allow it from our real mail box.
